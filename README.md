# Unity Defend Your Home
A small defense game inspired from Defend Your Castle, a classic flash game from the early 2000s. 
Can be played at https://bitflipp3r.itch.io/home-defender. Mostly a learning excerise for unity and not particularly fun or of high quality, you have been warned!

Most of the visual art assets are attributed to various folks on itch.io.
