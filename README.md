# Defend Your Home
A small defense game inspired from Defend Your Castle, a classic flash game from the early 2000s.
Can be played at https://bitflipp3r.itch.io/home-defender. This was a personal learning experience in unity and c# and a light hearted attempt at making a silly game that is enjoyable for a few minutes at best with a fun art style
. :)

Most of the visual art assets are attributed to various folks on itch.io.
